# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly)

Against all odds (and of course to stay on brand and ~~Defy God~~ ^tm) I somehow managed to get this bad boy in working order in only a mere 4 days, I even added some zesty personalization. Peep the Deets, crisp and in-line headers, **visually distinct** login, register, edit, and create sections! All readily discernable without the need to read any text! That's right ladies, gents, and non-binary friends, with this layout you know exactly where you are just by the position of the bars! Not sure about you, but I think that's pretty [badword] neat! With me you get a 241 deal, designer AND developer, I know ~~about half of~~ everything going on at any given moment!
